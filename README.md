# Cybersecurity Incident Report : Network Traffic Analysis


| **Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP traffic log.** |
| --- |
| The UDP protocol reveals that: As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was used to contact the DNS server to retrieve the IP address for the domain name of yummyrecipesforme.com. The ICMP protocol was used to respond with an error message, indicating issues contacting the DNS server. <br><br>This is based on the results of the network analysis, which show that the ICMP echo reply returned the error message: The UDP message going from your browser to the DNS server is shown in the first two lines of every log event. The ICMP error response from the DNS server to your browser is displayed in the third and fourth lines of every log event with the error message, **“udp port 53 unreachable.”** Since port 53 is associated with DNS protocol traffic, we know this is an issue with the DNS server. Issues with performing the DNS protocol are further evident because the plus sign after the query identification number `35084` indicates flags with the UDP message and the “A?” symbol indicates flags with performing DNS protocol operations. <br><br>The port noted in the error message is used for: Due to the ICMP error response message about port 53, it is highly likely that the DNS server is not responding. This assumption is further supported by the flags associated with the outgoing UDP message and domain name retrieval. <br><br>The most likely issue is: DNS server might be down due to a successful **Denial of Service attack** or a **misconfiguration**. |

| **Part 2: Explain your analysis of the data and provide at least one cause of the incident.** |

| **Time incident occurred:** The incident occurred today at **1:24 p.m.** <br><br> **Explain how the IT team became aware of the incident:** Customers notified the organization that they received the message **“destination port unreachable”** when they attempted to visit the website **yummyrecipesforme.com**. <br><br> **Explain the actions taken by the IT department to investigate the incident:** The cybersecurity team providing IT services to their client organization are currently investigating the issue so customers can access the website again. <br><br> **Note key findings of the IT department's investigation (i.e., details related to the port affected, DNS server, etc.):** In our investigation into the issue, we conducted packet sniffing tests using **tcpdump**. In the resulting log file, we found that DNS port **53 was unreachable**. <br><br> **Note a likely cause of the incident:** The most likely cause is that the DNS server became unavailable, either due to a **Denial of Service (DoS) attack** or **server misconfiguration**. |
